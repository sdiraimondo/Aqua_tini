            <strong>What does 'conditionally compliant' mean?</strong>
            <p>
            'Conditionally compliant' means that the server satisfies a certain
            minimum level of the requirements of the HTTP specification.
            Please consult Section 1.2 of
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec1.html#sec1.2">RFC
            2616, Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1</a>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <a name="building"></a><h2>Building</h2>

        <ul>
        <li class="spaced">
            <strong>The build is reported as successful, but no binary was
            built, and it displays this message: "<em>[tini] Could not find
            BuildDependency. Make sure you have it in your classpath</em>".
            What does this mean?</strong>
            <p>
            This usually means that Ant cannot find the TINI tools with which
            to convert your classes into a <tt>.tini</tt> executable.  Check
            that the <code><a href="building.html#tini.path">tini.path</a></code>
            setting in your <em><a href="building.html#buildConfig">build.properties</a></em>
            file is correct.  If you've used backslashes ('\'), then ensure
            that you use two backslashes when you mean one.  For example, if
            your TINI firmware is in <em>C:\tini1.12</em>, then specify
            </p>

            <blockquote class="example">
            <pre>tini.path=C:\\tini1.12</pre>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
            The reason for this is that properties files interpret the
            backslash as an escape, changing the meaning of the following
            character.  For example, <code>"\t"</code> represents a tab, and
            <code>"\\"</code> represents a single backslash.
            </p>

            <p>
            The preferred solution, however, is to use forward slashes for all
            file separators.  For example, use
            </p>

            <blockquote class="example">
            <pre>tini.path=C:/tini1.12</pre>
            </blockquote>

            <p>

            You need to use Ant version 1.5.x or later.</p>

            <strong>How do I decrease the size of the <em>.tini</em> binary?</strong>
            <p>
            Try removing unneeded <code>OneWireContainer</code> objects from the
            build by deleting the appropriate lines from
            <code><a href="building.html#dependency.groups">dependency.groups</a></code>
            in the <em><a href="building.html#buildConfig">build.properties</a></em>
            file.  Servlet reloading also takes up space with lots of
            reflection information, so this can also be excluded from the
            build.  Please see <a href="servletReloading.html#building">Building
            Reloading into the Binary</a>.</p>

            task or otherwise?</strong>
            <p>
            Try setting the FTP client to passive mode.  For the

            <tt><span class="blue">passive=</span><span class="green">"no"</span></tt>

            <strong>How do I add my own 1-Wire servlet?</strong>
            <p>
            Well, there are two ways:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>You can include it via the example <a href="exampleServlets.html#OneWireServlet">OneWireServlet</a>.
                </li>
            <li>Alternatively, you could write your own servlet that has nothing
                to do with the 1-Wire example, and map your own request path.
                Please see the <a href="ownServlets.html">writing your own
                servlets</a> document.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
        <li class="spaced">
            <strong>How do I add support for more 1-Wire containers?</strong>
            <p>
            Simply add the appropriate <code>OneWireContainer</code> object to the
            <code><a href="building.html#dependency.groups">dependency.groups</a></code>
            and <code><a href="building.html#reflect.classes">reflect.classes</a></code>
            properties in the
            <em><a href="building.html#buildConfig">build.properties</a></em>
            file.
            </p>
            <p>For example, to add support for the Thermocron iButton, add
            "OneWireContainer21" to <code>dependency.groups</code> and
            "com.dalsemi.onewire.container.OneWireContainer21" to
            <code>reflect.classes</code></p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <a name="execution"></a><h2>Execution</h2>

        <ul>
        <li class="spaced">
            <strong>How do I make the server start faster?</strong>
            <p>
            Try removing unnecessary lines from the
            <em><a href="servletProps.html">servlet.props</a></em> file.
            </p>
            </li>
        <li class="spaced">
            <strong>My logs say that my logfiles were mailed, but I don't receive
            them.  Why is this so?</strong>
            <p>
            There is a very strong possibility your mailhost isn't set.  You can
            accomplish this with the
            <tt class="noWrap">ipconfig -h &lt;mailhost&gt;</tt> Slush
            command.  Another possibility is that your mail server does not
            accept mail with a "From" domain it does not recognize.</p>
            </li>
        <li class="spaced">
            <strong>Why are there frequent <code>IOException</code>s in the
            log?</strong>
            <p>
            If the remote connection closes its connection before the server is
            finished reading or sending information, then an <code>IOException</code>
            will be thrown when attempting to read from or write to the socket
            connection.  This exception is not ignored by the server since there
            may be other reasons for this type of error within your own servlet.
            </p>
            <p>
            Now, while most errors within a servlet should be wrapped inside a
            <code>ServletException</code>, this may not be the case, and so an
            <code>IOException</code> may indicate a servlet problem not related
            to the connection.</p>
            </li>
        <li class="spaced">
            <strong>My server always responds with a "400 Bad Request" or "Invalid
            host." message.</strong>
            <p>
            The solution is to comment out the
            <code><a href="props.html#server.hostname">server.hostname</a></code>
            property in the <a href="props.html#server">server configuration</a>
            file.</p>
            <p>
            All HTTP/1.1 requests must have a "Host:" header in the request.  If
            the value of this header does not match the
            <code><a href="props.html#server.hostname">server.hostname</a></code>
            property, then this message will be returned.  Unless you know for
            sure that HTTP clients will be requesting this specific host, this
            property should not be set.</p>
            </li>
        <li class="spaced">
            <strong>Why does it give me the error, "Insufficient contiguous heap",
            when trying to start the server?</strong>
            <p>
            The TINI doesn't handle heap fragmentation very well, so even though
            your free memory may seem more than sufficient, there may not be a
            continuous block of memory with sufficient space for the server.  Try
            rebooting, and if that doesn't fix the problem, try clearing the heap
            and reloading the application.</p>
            <p>
            Note: You can reboot with the '-h' option to clear the heap.</p>
            </li>
        <li class="spaced">
            <strong>Why can't I find or instantiate class <i>X</i>?</strong>
            <p>
            If building the server for TINI firmware 1.1x, make sure to include
            the full class name in the <code><a href="building.html#reflect.classes">reflect.classes</a></code>
            build property.  Also, be sure to include the correct dependency group
            in the <code><a href="building.html#dependency.groups">dependency.groups</a></code>
            property if needed (1-Wire classes, for example).  Lastly, ensure that
            the syntax of each entry in the build file is correct.  For example,
            if a list spans multiple lines, then there should be a ",\" at each
            line break.</p>
            <p>
            Note that this problem can also manifest itself as a <tt>404 Not
            Found</tt> error when trying to access a servlet that "you just
            know is there".</p>
            </li>
        <li class="spaced">
            <strong>Why are new sessions created when it should be using a
            previously created one?</strong>
            <p>
            Make sure to get the session <em>before</em> calling
            <code>getOutputStream()</code>.  The reason is that session IDs
            are usually stored in the headers, and a call to
            <code>getOutputStream()</code> does not allow any more headers to
            be sent.  This is what is meant by a "committed response".</p>
            </li>
        <li class="spaced">
            <strong>Why am I getting a <code>NullPointerException</code> when
            constructing a new <code>URL</code> object?</strong>
            <p>
            First, make sure that the appropriate URL handler classes are
            included in the build (see
            <code><a href="building.html#dependency.groups">dependency.groups</a></code>
            and
            <code><a href="building.html#reflect.classes">reflect.classes</a></code>).
            If this does not solve the problem, then make sure you are using
            firmware 1.12 or later.
            </p>
            <p>
            There is a bug inside the algorithm that looks for appropriate
            handler classes for <code>URL</code>s.  It exists in firmware
            versions 1.11, 1.02f, and earlier.  It is fixed in firmware 1.12.
            </p>
            </li>
        <li class="spaced">
            <strong>Why is a <code>MalformedURLException</code> being thrown
            when creating a new <code>URL</code> object?</strong>
            <p>
            A <code>MalformedURLException</code> is thrown when the string
            could not be parsed as a valid URL, or a valid protocol
            <em>implementation</em> could not be found.  First check that the
            string is correct.  Next, ensure that the proper protocol handler
            classes are included, either in your source, or in the dependency
            classes.</p>
            <p>
            For example, to support the "http" protocol, add "HTTP" to the
            <code><a href="building.html#dependency.groups">dependency.groups</a></code>
            build property and "com.dalsemi.protocol.http.Handler" to
            <code><a href="building.html#classes.classes">reflect.classes</a></code>.
            </p>
            <p>
            In other words, if you're sure the URL is correct, then some
            classes are probably missing from the build.</p>

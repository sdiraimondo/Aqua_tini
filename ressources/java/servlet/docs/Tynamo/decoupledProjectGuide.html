        <p>
        It may be the case that you wish to leave the Tynamo&trade; distribution
        alone, and keep all your source and configuration files in a separate
        place.  This is possible to do, and does not take much effort to
        accomplish.
        </p>

        <p>
        The intended audience of this guide is those who have become moderately
        familiar with the Tynamo&trade; setup process.
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>
        In short, only the files to be sent to your TINI, your sources, and
        the two <em>*.properties</em> files need to be in your own project
        directory.  When you set the <tt>basedir</tt> Ant property, you will
        have completely separated your project from the Tynamo&trade;
        distribution.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
        <li class="spaced">
            First, create your own project directory.  For example, create
            <em>/Projects/coolserver</em>.  The disussion that follows will
            use this example.
            </li>
        <li class="spaced">
            Next, create the following subdirectories:
            <ul>
            <li><em>src</em> &mdash; This will contain your source files.</li>
            <li><em>tini</em> &mdash; This will contain all the files you wish
                to be transferred to your TINI.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        <li class="spaced">
            Lastly, copy <em>build.properties</em> and <em>deploy.properties</em>
            to the project directory.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
        <strong><big>[</big></strong>If you will be modifying the
        <em>build.xml</em> script then copy this file as well.  In this case,
        make sure to change the <code>deploy.root</code> property inside the
        script to the location of the Tynamo&trade; distribution.  To do this,
        replace the line that contains</p>
        <blockquote class="example">
        <pre>&lt;dirname property="distro.root" file="${ant.file}"/&gt;</pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>with a line that looks like</p>
        <blockquote class="example">
        <pre><strong>&lt;property name="distro.root" value="/tynamo-tini-1.0"/&gt;</strong></pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        Be sure, also, to replace <em>"/tynamo-tini-1.0"</em> with the actual
        location of the distribution.<strong><big>]</big></strong></p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Project Location &mdash; How to Use Ant</h2>

        <p>
        The <em>build.xml</em> file, by default, executes from the distribution
        location.  To override this, set the <tt><em>basedir</em></tt>
        property when starting Ant.
        </p>

        <p>
        For example, say your project directory is located in
        <em>/Projects/coolserver</em> and your Tynamo&trade; distribution is
        located in <em>/tynamo-tini-1.0</em>.  The two ways of setting this as
        your base project directory are as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        Change to <em>/Projects/coolserver</em> and execute:
        <pre class="example">ant -Dbasedir=. -f /tynamo-tini-1.0/build.xml</pre>
        OR:
        </li>
        <li>
        <pre class="example">ant -Dbasedir=/Projects/coolserver -f /tynamo-tini-1.0/build.xml</pre>
        </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
        The second option is more explicit, and probably safer to use in the
        presence of many different projects and project files.
        </p>

        <p>
        <big><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></big> Starting Ant this way is
        unnecessary if you have chosen to copy the <em>build.xml</em> file to
        your project directory.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Project Files</h2>

        <p>
        All your project files are arranged in the same way as the Tynamo&trade;
        distribution, just located in a different directory.
        </p>

        <h3>Source Files</h3>

        <p>
        Place all your source files into the <em>src/</em> directory you have
        just created (or another location of your choosing), and set up the
        <em>build.properties</em> file to use this as the source files
        location.  For example:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="example">
        <pre>src.paths=src
src.files=com/mycompany/servlet/**/*.java</pre>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>TINI Files</h3>

        <p>
        All the files to be transferred to your TINI server should reside in
        the <em>tini/</em> directory.  You can set up the contents by using
        the example in the distribution:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>tini/bin/</em> contains the webserver binary and configuration
            files,</li>
        <li><em>tini/http-root/</em> contains all your HTML, images, and
            web-accessible content, and</li>
        <li><em>tini/logs/</em> is left empty, and will contain your server and
            transfer log files.  Note that the <em>webserver.props</em> file
            controls where the logs are placed, so this can be changed or
            deleted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Build and Deployment Configuration</h3>

        <p>
        The <em>build.properties</em> and <em>deploy.properties</em> files are
        set up as usual.  Please consult the documentation for further details.
        The relevant documents include <a href="building.html">Building a
        Custom Web Server</a> and <a href="deploying.html">Deploying
        Tynamo&trade;-TINI with Ant</a>.
        </p>

        <!--<h2>Understanding the Configuration Files</h2>

        <p>
        It is worthwhile to summarize the function of each configuration file
        so that you can best understand how to manipulate them.
        </p>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="3">
            <tr>
                <th bgcolor="#ffffe0" align="left" valign="top">build.xml</th>
                <td>This is the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> build
                    script, and it references <em>build.properties</em> and
                    <em>deploy.properties</em>.  It is an integral part of the
                    distribution and may change between versions, so this file
                    should be kept in its original location to facilitate
                    future updates.
                    </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th bgcolor="#ffffe0" align="left" valign="top">build.properties</th>
                <td>This controls which project files are compiled, and which
                    classes are included in your custom build.  This file can
                    be copied into your own project location.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th bgcolor="#ffffe0" align="left" valign="top">deploy.properties</th>
                <td>The settings here determine where your server and all its
                    support files are sent.  This file can be copied into your
                    own project location.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Changing the Project Location</h2>

        <p>
        The <em>build.xml</em> file by default executes from the distribution
        location.  To override this, set the <tt><em>basedir</em></tt>
        property when starting Ant.
        </p>

        <p>
        For example, say your project directory is located in
        <em>/Projects/coolserver</em> and your Tynamo&trade; distribution is
        located in <em>/tynamo-1.0</em>.  The two ways of setting this as your
        base project directory are as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        Change to <em>/Projects/coolserver</em> and execute:
        <pre style="background-color: #f0f0ff">ant -Dbasedir=. -f /tynamo-1.0/build.xml</pre>
        OR:
        </li>
        <li>
        <pre style="background-color: #f0f0ff">ant -Dbasedir=/Projects/coolserver -f /tynamo-1.0/build.xml</pre>
        </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Customizing Your Build</h2>

        <p>
        The steps below will guide you through an example setup.  A directory
        named <em>/Projects/coolserver</em> is used as the project root, and
        <em>/tynamo-1.0</em> is used as the location of your Tynamo&trade;
        distribution.  These can be changed, of course, to suit your needs.
        </p>

        <ol>
        <li class="spaced">
            Create <em>/Projects/coolserver</em> and then create the following
            subdirectories:
            <ul style="background-color: #f0f0ff">
            <li>src</li>
            <li>tini</li>
            <li>tini/bin</li>
            <li>tini/http-root</li>
            <li>tini/logs</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <p>
            Everything underneath <em>tini/</em> is intended to be transferred
            to your TINI server.
            </p>
        <li class="spaced">
            Copy <em>build.properties</em> and <em>deploy.properties</em> from
            the distribution to the project root.
            </li>
        <li class="spaced">
            Copy the files from <em>tini/bin/</em> in the distribution into
            <em>tini/bin/</em> in the project root.  The list should include
            <em>webserver.props</em>, <em>servlets.props</em>, <em>mimeTypes.props</em>
            and possibly the <em>WebServer</em> script.  Next, modify these to
            suit your needs.
            <p>
            You don't need to copy the <em>.tini</em> binaries from the
            default distribution because you will be building your own.
            </p>
            </li>
        <li class="spaced">
            Place all your HTML, images, and web-accessible resources
            underneath <em>tini/http-root/</em> in the project root.
            </li>
        <li class="spaced">
            Place all your source code underneath <em>src/</em> in the project
            root.
            </li>
        <li class="spaced">
            In <em>build.properties</em>, add <tt>src</tt> to the
            <tt>src.paths</tt> list, and add your source files to the
            <tt>src.files</tt> list.
            </li>
        <li class="spaced">
            Finally, start Ant with the <tt>basedir</tt> property set to the
            project root, as described above.</li>
